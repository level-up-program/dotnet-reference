This is a very simple solution to demonstrate SpecFlow and living-doc, as well as simple commands for C# outside of Visual Studio.
* "make build" will clean and build this thing
* "make test" will test it and generate pretty output for SpecFlow tests in test-results folder
* Actions are configured to build and test on both main and develop
* Actions are configured to publish test results to gh-pages from develop
